* Haskell for Shell Scripting
*** To create a native library out of the haskell script
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    stack ghc -- -O2 example.hs
    #+END_SRC
*** Automatically running ghci commands on ghci startup
    Add a ~.ghci~ file in the current directory with the following contents:
    #+BEGIN_SRC text
    :set -XOverloadedStrings
    import Turtle
    #+END_SRC
    But this currently breaks things. I have to investigate why...
*** Format for printing out strings!
    #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
    format (s%" failed with exit code: "%d) cmd n
    #+END_SRC
    
    Type is inferred from the format string!
    #+BEGIN_SRC text
    Prelude Turtle> :type format (s%" failed with exit code: "%d)
    format (s%" failed with exit code: "%d) :: Text -> Int -> Text
    #+END_SRC

    The best alternative to string interpolation so far!
    #+BEGIN_SRC text
    *Main Turtle> :t format (s% "my name is " %s% " and I'm " %d% "years old, and I'm married with " %d)
    format (s% "my name is " %s% " and I'm " %d% "years old, and I'm married with " %d)
    :: (Integral n1, Integral n) => Text -> Text -> n -> n1 -> Text
    #+END_SRC
